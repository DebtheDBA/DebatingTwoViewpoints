# Debating Two Viewpoints on Indexing
Title: Debating Two Viewpoints on Indexing - Development vs Operations
Joint Session with Andy Yun ([@sqlbek](https://github.com/sqlbek))

Abstract: 
Who is responsible for indexing your application: operations or development?

Depending on the role, organizational structure, and access to the environment in need of indexing, the answer to that question may vary. So what should we do to make sure that our databases have the proper indexing when different roles, each with different priorities, own that responsibility?

If you can relate, and most of us can, come join Deborah and Andy for a technical yet fun debate on indexing, where we will each represent the development and operations viewpoints respectively. You can expect a lively exchange, where we will discuss various aspects of indexing, from creation, maintenance, and performance troubleshooting, from each differing viewpoint.

When you leave, you'll have a better appreciation for the "whys" that drive the two different viewpoints, enabling you to bridge the gap at your organization.
